# SimHub-BMW-E46-Cluster-Module
This repo contains all of the circuitry, code, and resources used to create a shield board for an Arduino Mega that could be used to communicate with a BWM E46 instrument cluster from a PC. The main application of this project was in using the cluster in conjunction with SimHub in order to show the values from the supported video games on the cluster's gauges.
